Product Management Dashboard – Full-Stack Interview Preparation Guide

🔧 Project Summary

A responsive, performant Product Management Dashboard built using React (Hooks only), Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, without TypeScript or any UI libraries. It features live product interaction, cart functionality, data table controls, and in-memory data operations with clean UI/UX and modular code. The entire project has been rebuilt 100% originally and is plagiarism-free while maintaining identical design, constraints, and feature set.

🚀 Development Approach (Step-by-Step)

🟩 1. Project Setup

Initialized using Vite + React (npm create vite@latest)

Installed and configured Tailwind CSS with PostCSS (tailwind.config.cjs, postcss.config.cjs)

Used module format as defined by Vite and ES modules

Created modular folder structure by components/, utils/, and core files (App.jsx, main.jsx)

🟩 2. Mock Data Generation

Built generateMockProducts(count) to simulate 1000+ realistic products

Each has ID, name, category, price, stock, status, image URL

Used https://picsum.photos/seed/${id}/80/80 to dynamically load valid images

🟩 3. App Structure (App.jsx)

Renders the layout with Header, StatsCards, ProductTable, and CartSidebar

Maintains product and cart state locally (no localStorage per requirement)

Handles cart operations: add, update quantity, remove

🟩 4. Feature Implementation

✅ Cart Functionality

Maintained entirely in-memory using React useState

Cart opens as a sidebar with full product list and quantity buttons

Total price is auto-calculated

Add, remove, and update quantity of products

Persistence across page refresh using sessionStorage (as per spec)

✅ Product Table Showcase

Displayed as a styled table with Tailwind CSS

Columns: ID, Image, Name, Category, Price, Stock, Status, Actions

Each row supports:

Edit (modal popup)

Delete (removes from array)

View Details (modal popup)

✅ Pagination

10 items per page

Logic implemented via paginateData(data, page, limit)

Prev/Next navigation buttons dynamically render new page slice

✅ Lazy Loading

Uses useMemo() to compute only the visible data slice

Prevents unnecessary re-renders and DOM bloat

✅ Search & Filter

Debounced search input to filter by name or category

useDebounce() hook throttles input frequency

✅ Sortable Columns

Column headers toggle ASC/DESC on click

sortConfig holds current sort field & direction

sortedData computed via memoization

✅ Drag & Drop Columns

Pure HTML5 drag & drop logic

Each <th> has draggable, onDragStart, onDrop handlers

Columns reordered via setColumns() state update

✅ Responsive Design

Tailwind utility classes ensure mobile-first layout

Cards stack on small screens, tables scroll horizontally

🔍 Optimizations

useMemo and useCallback to memoize computed data

useDebounce() to avoid excessive filtering

Minimized re-renders through isolated components

Avoided rendering off-screen data (only 10 rows per page)

Image URLs with seed hash for better caching

🧩 Challenges & Solutions

🟠 Session-Based Cart (No LocalStorage)

Challenge: Must persist during session without localStorage
Solution: Used sessionStorage with useEffect to sync cart on every update

🟠 Drag & Drop Without Libraries

Challenge: No external DnD libraries allowed
Solution: HTML5 native dragstart, dragover, drop events on <th> tags to reorder columns

🟠 Large Data Performance

Challenge: Render and interact with 1000+ items
Solution: Implemented paginateData(), useMemo, and debounced search to throttle expensive operations

🟠 UI Polish Without Design Systems

Challenge: No UI library (e.g., Chakra, Material UI)
Solution: Tailwind CSS with consistent spacing, typography, and rounded cards for smooth look

🟠 Unique & Original Implementation

Challenge: Must not use copied or templated code
Solution: Custom-designed every component from scratch following only the rules and visual references

⚙️ Tech Stack Recap

React (Hooks Only)

Tailwind CSS

Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)

Vite (for modern dev environment)

✅ Final Notes

This dashboard has been developed from the ground up using original, custom-written logic and structure. It mirrors the specified UI and rules without reusing any external templates or copied logic. This makes it ideal for showcasing frontend engineering skill and architecture thinking in interviews.
